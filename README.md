# NVML Bindings for Go [![API Documentation][godoc-svg]][godoc-url] [![MIT License][license-svg]][license-url]

## NOTE: This project has been abandoned. It's no longer needed at my job, so I won't be maintaining it.

This package provides bindings to Nvidia's NVML library.


## Status

It's mostly an experiment to learn cgo. I wouldn't actually use this for
anything for a while.

## Usage

### Basic

```go
package main

import nvml "github.com/davidr/go-nvml"

// To be completed later
```
